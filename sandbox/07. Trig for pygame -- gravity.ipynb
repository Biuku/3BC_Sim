    "## Problem statement\n",
    "- In my AngryBats sidebar project, I've calibrated gravity to closely mimic reality -- i.e., within that world I know how many feet above the ground the ball is, and I can drop it from a height and it will accelerate down and hit the ground in the time that physics predicts it will take.\n",
    "- But when I launch the ball -- mimicking contact with a bat -- everything is weird:\n",
    "    - Gravity has very little effect on the ball unless I reduce its launch velow a lot. I.e., it's like being on the moon -- the ball travels up 30', across 30', down 30' ... in like half a minute!\n",
    "#### I want to understand why. \n",
    "- First hypothesis -- it has to do with how I track time. Time is the exponential variable in acceleration, and I am tracking it in full seconds. Whereas Pygame uses miliseconds... so maybe other developers default to miliseconds."
